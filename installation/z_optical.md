# How to wire the Z Optical port and sensor

**This sensor is not used for Klipper**, however the connections were brought to the new board since the ribbon contains them. This gives you 3 spare wires and ports to use for _anything you wish_.
The connection terminates directly in front of the left Z motor. A 3-pin JST extension cable can be used in order to utilize this port for RGB LEDs or any 3-pin device if desired.
